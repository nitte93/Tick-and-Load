Consider the page is divided into two columns. The one on the left should have a countdown timer, a text box below and 'Start' button. The textbox should validate the input only when the time entered is in format HH:MM:SS (Including the colons). The one on the right should have a loading bar which is incremented with value x whenever the seconds pulse of the timer hits multiples of five. Calculate x in a way that, when the countdown timer ticks 00:00:00, at the same time the loading bar should reach 100%.
